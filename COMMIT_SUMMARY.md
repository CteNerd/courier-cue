## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
1. **Driver 404 Error on Load Details** - Fixed ID field mismatch (id vs loadId)
2. **Admin Load Row Not Clickable** - Added onClick handler with proper event propagation
3. **Dock Type Pills Not Showing** - Fixed field name mismatch (type vs dockType)
4. **Trailer Data Fields Missing** - Updated mock data to match interface structure
5. **Date Calculation Logic** - Fixed compliance calculations to use real-time date comparisons

### Data Migration
- Added automatic field name migration in mockApi for backward compatibility
- Handles old field names (name → trailerNumber, type → dockType, etc.)
- Ensures localStorage data works with updated interfaces

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
✅ Trailers page - Create, edit, view with compliance calculations
✅ Docks page - Create, edit, view with dock yard relationships  
✅ Dock Yards page - Create, edit, view
✅ Load creation with trailer/dock selection
✅ Load details page showing trailer information
✅ Compliance status updates in real-time
✅ Mock data initialization and persistence
✅ Data migration logic for old field names
✅ Public homepage and about page rendering
✅ Navigation switching based on auth state
✅ Dark mode on all new pages
✅ Responsive design on mobile/tablet

### Verified Scenarios
- Admin creating load with trailer assignment
- Driver viewing load with trailer info (read-only)
- Trailer compliance changing based on current date
- Dock auto-populating from selected trailer
- Warning showing for non-compliant trailers
- localStorage clearing and reinitialization
- Public page navigation and CTAs
- Authenticated user bypassing public pages

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Environment Setup
The application is ready for deployment with both mock and real API support:

**Development/Demo Mode:**
```bash
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true
```
- Uses localStorage-based mock data
- No backend required
- Includes realistic demo data

**Production Mode:**
```bash
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=false
```
- Connects to real API endpoints
- All backend functions already implemented
- Seed script ready for database initialization

### Database Seeding
Run seed script to populate backend with demo data:
```bash
bash docker/seed.sh
```

This creates:
- 3 dock yards
- 5 docks
- 6 trailers
- 1 demo load
- 4 demo users (admin, coadmin, 2 drivers)
