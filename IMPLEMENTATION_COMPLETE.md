## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Compliance Calculation
```typescript
function calculateCompliance(trailer: Trailer): 'COMPLIANT' | 'NEEDS_UPDATING' {
  const now = new Date();
  const regExpired = trailer.registrationExpiresAt 
    ? new Date(trailer.registrationExpiresAt) < now 
    : true;
  const inspExpired = trailer.inspectionExpiresAt 
    ? new Date(trailer.inspectionExpiresAt) < now 
    : true;
  
  return (trailer.isRegistrationCurrent && !regExpired && 
          trailer.isInspectionCurrent && !inspExpired)
    ? 'COMPLIANT' 
    : 'NEEDS_UPDATING';
}
```

### Event Propagation Fix
```typescript
// Prevent row click when clicking buttons
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  openAssignModal(load);
}}
```

### Auto-Population Logic
```typescript
// When trailer selected, auto-populate its current dock
onChange={(e) => {
  setSelectedTrailerId(e.target.value);
  if (e.target.value) {
    const trailer = trailers.find(t => t.trailerId === e.target.value);
    if (trailer?.currentDockId) {
      setSelectedDockId(trailer.currentDockId);
    }
  }
}}
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
// Only show trailer section if trailer data exists
{(load as any).trailer && (
  <div>
    {/* Trailer information */}
  </div>
)}
```

- **Admin/CoAdmin**: Full CRUD access to trailers, docks, dock yards
- **Backend enforcement**: All API endpoints have proper role checks (already implemented)

### API Client Configuration
- ✅ **Smart switching** via `USE_MOCK_API` flag in `web/src/lib/api.ts`

## �🚀 What's Next

The application is now feature-complete per the specification. Suggested next steps:

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real backend API
2. **Seed Data**: Run `docker/seed.sh` to populate local DynamoDB
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from drivers and admins
4. **Performance**: Monitor load times for trailer/dock lists
5. **Documentation**: Update user guides with new features
6. **Training**: Train users on trailer/dock management
